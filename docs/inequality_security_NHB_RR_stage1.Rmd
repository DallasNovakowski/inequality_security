abstract: |
  A growing body of evidence suggests that economic inequality causes humans to take more risks and engage in aggressive behaviours. In a 'winner-takes-all' environment, risky activities such as gambling, lying, and crime can be a person's only means of keeping up with competitors and accessing contested resources. There is comparatively little research investigating whether people anticipate risk-taking and conflict from their neighbors in unequal environments. An informative context for examining the distrust-inducing effects of inequality is the security market, which offers goods that protect customers from the actions of malicious agents. For instance, barred windows are purchased because they (purportedly) protect consumers from break-ins. Given the costly nature of these security products, security consumption can only be worthwhile if a consumer expects that other people have harmful intentions. 
  
  The proposed research will examine whether inequality will increase consumers' willingness to purchase security products through two studies: 1) experimental manipulations of inequality and distributional fairness in an economic game context, and 2) multilevel analyses of the effects of nation-level inequality (k = 28) on individuals' consumption of security goods (n = 52,908).

Income and wealth inequalities have risen sharply in the US in the past 30 years [@horowitz2020], this trend is of particular importance because a growing body of evidence suggests that economic inequality can lead to undesirable consequences. At a societal level, inequality has been associated with higher nation-level homicide rates [@daly2016], consumer debt [@christen2005], and reduced cooperation [@burton-chellew2013 ; @anderson2008], while at an individual level, inequality causes people to be more likely to resort to risky, hostile, and criminal activities in desperate attempts to compete for otherwise inaccessible positions and resources [@mishra2015; @payne2017; @krupp2018].

Two accounts have been proposed to explain how population-level inequality influences risk-taking in individuals. Both of which follow from risk-sensitivity theory, which predicts that organisms will take risks when more predictable strategies cannot meet the organism's goals (e.g., starvation thresholds). Accordingly, inequality fosters risk-taking by increasing the distance between individuals and their goals. First, inequality increases risk-taking through *absolute deprivation*; unequal societies tend to have more poverty, and poor people are more likely to take risks to meet their basic needs [@pridemore2008]. Second, risk-taking can be a response to envy (or *relative deprivation*), where even well-off individuals feel disadvantaged when compared to others, then take risks in an attempt to keep up with peers and a socially-defined reference point [@mishra2017].

Despite evidence for inequality's role in increasing risk-taking, simulation, cross-country, and panel data suggest that inequality also fosters a special case of risk aversion: low social trust [@knack1997; @zak2001; @berggren2006; @leigh2006; @bjørnskov2007; @wilkinson2010; @elgar2010; @barone2016; @decourson2021]. For instance, @barone2016 found that among OECD countries, inequality is associated with lower country-level trust, as computed from the World Values Survey. Several theoretical streams have emerged to explain how inequality reduces trust. Each of these explanations are limited to certain contexts; for example, ranging from changes in intergroup contact, opportunity costs of vigilance, and incentives for antisocial behaviour [reviewed in @jordahl2007].

Currently, the most rigorous investigation of how inequality impacts distrust in populations is found in a simulation study by @decourson2021. They found that in unequal environments, worse-off individuals will tend to be in poverty, and will try to exploit cooperative groups (as suggested by risk-sensitivity theory), leading others in a population to eventually avoid cooperation altogether. @decourson2021's theory is explicitly focused on poverty (i.e. absolute deprivation). However, in many instances, poverty and inequality do not co-occur. For instance, some workplaces and neighborhoods have little to no absolute deprivation, but they can still exhibit substantial stratification; in such a circumstance, @decourson2021's compositional model of inequality would not predict any reduced trust. We argue that considerations of others' *relative deprivation* can help to extend this inequality-trust theory to other important contexts.

People appear to demonstrate an aversion to being the subject of social comparisons and feelings of envy. Data from small-scale preindustrial societies suggests that many individuals hold "evil eye beliefs;" superstitions that a mere envious glance can cause material harm. Moreover, these beliefs are most prevalent in societies with high wealth inequality [@gershman2015]. Likewise, a major feature of scandinavian culture is the "Jante Law" (or Janteloven/Jantelagen), which explicitly discourages individual superiority, ambition, and nonconformity. [e.g., "You musn't think you are anything special;" @sandemose1936]. Anglo-Saxon societies refer to the 'cutting down' of 'tall poppies', and in Asian cultures, 'the nail that stands out gets hammered down'

If envious peers are more likely to act spitefully and take risks, being able to anticipate or detect disparities among peers may be helpful in protecting oneself from harmful behaviours. These patterns of envy aversion seem adaptive when considering the risk- and conflict- inducing effects of inequality. Indeed, theories have been proposed that predict a "fear-of-envy" equilibrium, where concerns over partner's destructive envy can reduce people's likelihood to engage in wealth-creating behaviours [@gershman2014; @brams2005].

This project will operate under the assumption that the purchase and use of security products is a consumer manifestation of distrust. Currently, most research on the inequality-trust relationship is based on attitudinal measures (REF). While informative tools for otherwise unobservable internal states, these psychological measures provide little information on how trust and distrust manifest in people's behaviours. Security products may thus be informative because security products are one of the few goods that confer little intrinsic value to consumers. Whereas vacations are inherently satisfying, the costs of burglar alarms, sturdy locks, and security cameras are often only worthwhile *if consumers expect that other agents may cause them harm*. This project aims to test an envy aversion model of distrust and security consumption, which predicts that **H1)** inequality increases security consumption because people expect disadvantaged peers to experience envy.

This theory of envy avoidance also addresses the role of fairness in shaping the type of envy an individual experiences. Benign envy is associated with a motivation to improve oneself, and occurs when an individual believes that the envied person's advantage is deserved . By contrast, malicious envy is characterized by a desire to harm the comparison target, and is elicited when the individual believes that their environment is unfair [@vandeven2012]. Participants are are more likely to engage in helping behaviours when they believe that their partner is frustrated by the disparity and harboring antagonistic motivations [i.e., experiencing malicious envy; see @vandeven2010]. Conversely, participants who earned an advantaged position (which is associated with benign envy) tend to be less generous [@hoffman1994]. As such, this project will also test the prediction that **H2)** Inequality will have a smaller effect on security consumption when incomes are earned, and that **H3)** Individuals will consume more security when inequality is the result of group-based favoritism.

This theory of envy aversion makes similar directional predictions as some existing inequality-distrust theories, but makes these predictions under more generalized circumstances. Even in the absence of absolute poverty, larger material incentives for antisocial behaviour, or different opportunity costs, this model would still predict that inequality increases distrust and security consumption, out of the person's efforts to protect themselves against envious reactions. The mechanism of envy aversion is specific to predicting reduced trust towards less wealthy individuals among a reference group. This theory will be tested through a multimethod project of five experiments (Study 1) and one multilevel analysis using the International Crime Victimization Survey [Study 2; @vankesteren2010] to examine the relationship between economic inequality and individual consumption of products that protect users against their neighbors.

# Methods

<!-- **The Methods section in Letters and Articles should ideally not exceed 3,000 words but may be longer if necessary** -->

For all of the proposed studies, data collection and analysis will not be performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.

Timeline for completion of the study and proposed resubmission date if Stage 1 review is successful

## Ethics information

All procedures for this project have been approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint Faculties Research Ethics Board (REB 20-1860). For the experimental studies, informed consent will be obtained for all participants, who, unless otherwise noted, will be compensated at a rate of \$12.48 CAD/hour.

For multilevel analyses, the International Crime Victimization Survey, Standardized World Income Inequality Database, and Penn World Tables are publicly-available archival datasets. As such, ethics approval and informed consent was obtained, and compensation disbursed, by the original researchers.

## Study 1 - Experimental studies in Inequality

### Proposed sample characteristics (Sampling plan; Study 1)

Participants will be recruited through the crowdsourcing platform Prolific Academic. Sampled participants will be filtered for fluency in English, balanced for an equal gender representation, and only eligible if they have not completed an earlier experiment in this series.

After data collection, participants will be screened based on two attention checks and two items testing their task comprehension. After data collection, participants will be excluded from analyses unless they pass both attention checks, and both comprehension check items (the pretest implement a relaxed comprehension check because only 67% of participants correctly answered a single-item comprehension check). Participants will also be excluded if they have missing data for any of the measures. Erroneous or missing data will result in the participants' data excluded from analyses

<!--# Regardless of sampling method, you must list all criteria for data inclusion and/or data exclusion and how this affects your sampling strategy. This includes a full description of proposed sample characteristics. Procedures for objectively defining exclusion criteria due to technical errors or for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under what conditions data would be replaced. These details must be summarized in the mandatory Design table (Table @ref(tab:design-table)). -->

### Experimental procedures (Design; Study 1)

The Prolific-recruited participants will complete the studies on oTree [@chen2016], an open-source platform for conducting single- and multiplayer experiments and surveys. oTree studies are written largely in html, python, and javascript, which can be saved and shared in their raw code form, allowing for easy sharing, reproduction, and modification of protocols.

The experiments will be conducted in the context of two-player economic game, called the security game [@tambe2011]. In this modification of the security game, participants are paired with an anonymous partner, with each being given an endowment of funds (e.g., \$2 each). Then, participants are told that their partner will have the opportunity to try to steal money from them (e.g., \$1 at a 50% chance of success, with failed thievery attempts instead making the partner lose \$1). After learning this information, participants can spend some of their money on security products (e.g., \$0.02 per unit), with each unit of security visibly reducing the probability of a successful thievery attempt (1% reduction per unit).

The security game experiments will take place across five studies, testing the effects of inequality on security consumption (1a), and with real monetary payoffs (1b), and go on to manipulate (hypothetical) stake sizes (1c). The last two experiments will assess the effects of inequality when endowments are due to one's own efforts (versus random; 1d), and whether apparent group-based discrimination increases security consumption under conditions of inequality (1e). In each study, participants will be randomly assigned to a between-subjects conditions.

Economic games examining self-protection are not new. Most notably, @mcevily2012 devised a behavioural distrust game, whereby participants choose whether to incur a cost that guarantees that their partner splits a surplus income equally. Compared to the distrust game, the security game is explicitly probabilistic - partners have a risky choice to take funds for themselves, and security expenditures reduce the probability of successful "attacks."

### Pilot data (Study 1)

A on n=`r screened_n` crowdsourced (Prolific) participants was conducted to calibrate the price of security (\$0.02 vs. \$0.04) and the baseline likelihood of successful thefts (50%, 60%, 75%). A mixed model found no significant effects of baseline likelihood of successful thefts `r inline_extract(pretest_model,"as.numeric(prob)")` nor security price `r inline_extract(pretest_model,"cost")`; Figure \@ref(fig:pretest-splitplot)). This project will use a baseline 50% chance of successful thefts, and each unit of security costing \$0.02. This condition also seems to produce the least skewed data, at `r round(base_skew,2)` (e.g., compared to skew = `r round(skew_groups["75_02"],2)` when probability is 75% and price \$0.02). The pretest had two attention checks and one comprehension check.

<!-- participants has already been conducted to find which values of base successful thefts and security prices yielded a favourable distribution in security consumption, while avoiding ceiling/floor effects. After examining the data (Figure @ref(fig:pretest-splitplot)), baseline probabilities of successful thefts and security price had  -->

### Measurement and variables (Study 1)

Throughout these experiments, participants will be asked to choose how many units of a security product they wish to consume, ranging from 0 to 50. For the purposes of analysis and interpretation, security spending will serve as the final dependent variable. Security spending will be computed by multiplying the number of security units consumed by the good's per-unit cost, in this case, \$0.02.

Given the constraints on the minimum and maximum values for the variables in the experimental designs, outliers are considered legitimate values and will not be deleted. Instead, influential observations will be winzorized to the 5th and 95th percentile values (using r function `DescTools::Winsorize`). Influential observations will be flagged as having cook's distance values exceeding the threshold 4/n; where n = \# of observations.

### Study 1a: Inequality and security spending

The first experiment will manipulate high versus low inequality in a hypothetical context. Participants will be asked to imagine that they are paired with another participant, where they will each be assigned to different roles (Blue or Yellow), and endowed with money. In the equal condition, participants will be told that their partner received the same amount of funds as themselves (\$2), whereas in the unequal condition, participants will be told that their partner received only \$1. This procedure has a notable strength by controlling the participant's income across levels of inequality (as the partner's money is the only income that changes).

#### A priori power analysis (Study 1a)

Using mean and standard deviation values of security expenditure (*M*=`r base_mean`, *SD*=`r base_sd`) from the pretest, an a priori power analysis has been conducted using r package SuperPower [@lakens2021], with `r nsims` simulations. Given the unknown size of the hypothesized effect, this study will target an effect size of partial $\eta^2$ = .01. To achieve 95% power, studies must have a minimum of n = `r l2cell_n_01` participants per cell, or a study-wide total of n=`r format(l2cell_n_01*2,big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`. Figures \@ref(fig:l2-design) and \@ref(fig:powerplot2) display the pattern of means and per-condition sample size thresholds to obtain 95% power. Additionally, see Tables \@ref(tab:l2anovaexact) and \@ref(tab:l2pairwiseexact) for the power and effect sizes of the ANOVA and pairwise comparisons, respectively.

### Study 1b: Inequality with real payoffs

The use of hypothetical scenarios in Study 1a may limit the reliability of any results. For instance, compared to hypothetical rewards, @xu2016 found that participants take fewer risks when incentivized by real payoffs and experiencing negative feedback [see @hertwig2001 for a summary on the mixed impacts of hypothetical choices]. Study 1b will serve to replicate study 1a, with the sole difference being whether participants believe they are playing with a real partner, and whether their decision has real stakes.

### Study 1c: Stake Size

The same inequality experiment will be conducted as in Study 1b, with the exception of manipulating the stake size of participants' (hypothetical decision)*.* This study will serve to further replicate the effect inequality on security consumption, while testing the generalizability of the effect.

### Study 1d: Meritocracy

Groups will always be characterized by inequality through some type of currency, whether wealth, income, or status. Indeed, a popular idea is that inequality propels individuals towards productive behaviours (REF). In this line, the presence of inequality is less of an issue compared to the distributional fairness in how the inequality was produced. The next two experiments will test whether distributional fairness moderates the effect of inequality on security consumption. Study 1d again varies inequality (hi/none), but also manipulates whether one's income is allocated **randomly or based on task performance**, to test whether test the hypothesis that a meritocratic distribution of wealth will mitigate the positive effect of inequality on security spending.

<!--# competing hypothesis: deserved superiority will lead to a greater desire to retain relative positioning –> more consumption - could nullify or reverse -->

#### A priori power analysis (Study 1d)

Study 1d requires statistical power to detect a "no-way" interaction. Given the unknown size of the hypothesized effect, this study will target an effect size of partial $\eta^2$ = .01. To achieve 95% power, studies must have a minimum of `r cell_n_01` participants per cell, or a study-wide total of n=`r format(cell_n_01*4,big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`. This large sample size is necessary given the possibility of a "no-way" interaction, where only one condition is significantly different from the remainder. In this case, the simple effect of inequality is nullified depending on the moderator. @simonsohn2015 discusses how, in a no-way interaction, samples require at least twice as many subjects per cell as a study that simply aims to show the simple effect.

For a visual breakdown of hypotheses, see Figures \@ref(fig:concept-modmed) and \@ref(fig:detail-modmed). Figures \@ref(fig:design) and \@ref(fig:powerplot) display the pattern of means and per-condition sample size thresholds to obtain 95% power. Additionally, see Tables \@ref(tab:anovaexact) and \@ref(tab:pairwiseexact) for the power and effect sizes of the ANOVA and pairwise comparisons, respectively.

```{r merit-define-model, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
m_merit <- lm(security_spending ~ inequality*merit, data = ineq_merit_data)
```

### Study 1e: Group membership

As described in the literature review to Study 1d, fairness appears to have its roots in avoiding partiality. Since Study 1d directly compares meritocratic versus random allocation of resources, it does not answer the more fundamental question: do people consume more security goods when inequality is more clearly discriminatory and unfair? Study 1e will keep a constant presence of inequality, but manipulate whether the partner is a member of an ingroup or outgroup, and whether the incomes are distributed randomly, by an **ingroup third-party**.

```{r group-define-model, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
m_group <- lm(security_spending ~ agentic*outgroup, data = ineq_merit_data)
```

## Study 2 -Multilevel Analysis of the International Crime Victimization Survey

The highly-controlled nature of the experiments in Study 1 allow for precise tests of the hypothesized inequality-security consumption relationship. Although they offer real consequences for participants' choices, economic games are highly artificial by design. Insights generated in the security game may not be generalizable to consumers' daily consumption context. To provide a test with greater external validity, this project supplements experimental results with the multilevel analysis of archival data assessing respondents' use of security measures.

The format of a registered report carries substantial benefit when analyzing archival data, as such data-dependent analysis, the so-called "garden of forking paths [@gelman2014] allows a researcher to pick and choose those data and analyses that best suit their preferred conclusions[@simmons2011]. The commitment to reprocessing and analysis plans before model estimation helps to reduce these researcher degrees of freedom.

### Study 2 - experimental procedures (Design)

The relationship between country-level inequality and the consumption of security products will be tested using a multilevel linear regression. This analysis will be accomplished using a combination of three archival datasets: the International Crime Victimization Survey, the Standardized World Income Inequality Database, and the Penn World Tables.

<!-- Atkinson and Brandolini (2001) discuss these and several related pitfalls in their excellent survey on the use of secondary data sets in studies of income inequality. -->

### Study 2 - Proposed sample characteristics (Sampling plan)

First, indicators of security consumption have been accessed from the International Crime Victimization survey [ICVS, @vankesteren2010], which has surveyed over 300,000 people across `r cleaned_countries` different countries on householders' experiences with crime, policing, crime prevention, and feelings of unsafety. Second, nation-level inequality in disposable income was accessed through the Standardized World Income Inequality Database [SWIID, @solt2020]. The SWIID has been designed to maximize the comparability of income inequality data while maintaining the widest possible coverage across countries and over time. Lastly, countries' expenditure-side real GDP and populations were retrieved from the [Penn World Table, PWT; version 10.0; see @feenstra2015].

Although the above datasets extend across multiple years, the current analysis will be limited to observations across 2004-2006. These observations were collected across two distinct sweeps in the ICVS, with one being specific to the European Union. Imposing this restriction yields a sufficient initial number of cases (`r format(sweep5_nrow, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`) and countries (`r sweep5_countries`) before screening, combined with relative recency of data. By contrast, all data collected by the ICVS between 2010 and 2015 only totals only twelve countries, before screening.

Observations were excluded for participants that refused response on any analysis-relevant measures. Likewise, observations were dropped that had country-wide missing responses on any predictor and outcome measures. Such countries being dropped from analyses include Switzerland (missing security items), Hong Kong (missing age), and Estonia (missing relationship status<!--# and experiences of motortheft -->).

Notably, the number of participants and countries dropped from analyses can be heavily impacted by the selection of variables targeted for analyses. For instance, including perceived police effectiveness in any analyses would require dropping the countries of Japan, Peru, and Iceland. Likewise, including participants' experiences of assault would require removing Peru. Lastly, analyzing participants' income quartiles requires removing Japan.

Including all three of these variables yields k = `r sum(summary(iv_2005_mod$country)>0)` countries, and n = `r format(nrow(iv_2005_mod), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` participants. By comparison, excluding these three variables yields a sample of `r sum(summary(iv_2005$country)>0)` countries and a total `r format(nrow(iv_2005), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` participants. The reported analyses will focus on the former, smaller sample specification, but supplementary analyses will assess whether the effects of a reduced model (i.e., excluding assaults, income quartile, and perceived police effectiveness) change between these sample subsets.

<!-- , with a minimum of `r min(summary(iv_2005$country)[summary(iv_2005$country)!= 0])` participants per country.  -->

<!-- comment on confounds between security measures and home ownership -->

### Study 2 - Measurement and Variables

#### Outcome variable

```{r prev-var-recode, echo = FALSE}
prevention_min2 <- dplyr::recode(prevention_min2, "prev_burglar_alarm" = "burglar alarm", "prev_special_door_locks" = "special door locks", "prev_special_grills" = "window grills", "prev_high_fence" = "high perimeter fence", "prev_caretaker_security" = "presence of a caretaker who provides security")

```

Security consumption (*M* = `r mean(iv_2005_mod$total_security)`, *SD* = `r sd(iv_2005_mod$total_security)`) has been computed by summing respondents' self-reported ownership of `r as.english(length(prevention_min2))` different preventative measures: `r glue::glue_collapse(x = prevention_min2, ", ", last = ", and ")`. This variable excludes several security items in the ICVS due to missing data, such as owning a watch dog, having surveillance arrangements with neighbors, and purchasing insurance against criminal activities.

<!-- a burglar alarm, special door locks, special grills, a high perimeter fence, and caretaker security. -->

#### Predictor variables

The focal model will include predictor variables at country- and individual-levels: at the nation level, 1) nation-level inequality (gini - disposable income), 2) expenditure-side GDP per capita (matched purchasing power parity), and 3) nation-level self-reported crime victimization; and at the respondent level: 1) age (five-year increments), 2) gender (`r round(summary(iv_2005_mod$gender)["female"]/nrow(iv_2005_mod)*100,0)`% female), 3) employed (`r round(summary(iv_2005_mod$employed)[1]/nrow(iv_2005_mod)*100,0)`% employed), 4) income quartile, 5) relationship status (`r round(summary(iv_2005_mod$partnered)[1]/nrow(iv_2005_mod)*100,0)`% partnered), 6) number of individual victimization experiences, and 7) perceived police effectiveness, range = `r min(iv_2005_mod$police_effective)`-`r max(iv_2005_mod$police_effective)`). See Table \@ref(tab:s2desc-tab) for remaining descriptive statistics.

As an index of inequality, the Gini coefficient is most intuitively defined as the average difference in income between all pairs in a population, divided by twice the average income in the population. The SWIID consists of 100 separate dataframes, with varying gini values to reflect the values' uncertainty (i.e., larger standard errors) when making comparisons across different countries or time periods.

<!-- "The inequality estimates and their associated uncertainty are represented by 100 draws from the posterior distribution: for any given observation, the differences across these imputations capture the uncertainty in the estimate" -->

The PWT-selected GDP values are adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, "to compare relative living standards across countries at a single point in time" [@feenstra2015]. Nations' GDP values were divided by their population sizes to yield a per-capita GDP value, which will be used for these analyses.

```{r vic-var-recode, echo = FALSE}
vic_var_assault <- dplyr::recode(vic_var_assault, "cartheft_5yrs" = "car thefts", "motortheft_5yrs" = "motor vehicle thefts", "bicyctheft_5yrs" = "bicycle thefts", "burglar_5yrs" = "burglaries", "attempt_5yrs" = "attempted burglaries", "robbery_5yrs" = "robberies", "pers_theft_5yrs" = "thefts", "assault_5yrs"="physical assaults")
```

Self-reported crime victimization will likewise be computed as a count variable for the following items: `r glue::glue_collapse(x = vic_var_assault, ", ", last = ", and ")`, summing `r as.english(length(vic_var_assault))` binary items on respondent's experiences of victimization. This variable will be represented twice in the analyses - once as a nation-average value, and again for the individual respondent.

### Proposed analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, precise description of all planned analyses

Since the ICVS, SWIID, and PWT are publicly available, preprocessing and inclusion/exclusion steps have already been implemented, and are available in the sourced and attached code. A notable preprocessing steps is that gini and gdp values were averaged across 2004-2006 into a single index, to reflect the years where the survey sweeps were conducted.

Analyses will be predict security consumption as an ordinal variable (0: no security consumption, 1: one unit of security consumption, 2: two units, or 3: three or more units consumed), using a cumulative link mixed model. The outcome variable exhibits excessive skewness, and is not suitable to a linear model. Likewise, despite security consumption being a count variable of multiple binary occurrences, it is unlikely to meet the assumptions for a poisson process, which assumes that the maximum value stretches out indefinitely.

The coefficient estimates and standard errors will be extracted through simulations. Using `smvrnorm` function from the `stevemisc` package, the distributions for fixed-effects estimates will be generated from 100 dataframes, which each consist of coefficients and variance/covariance matrices from a model. These distributions will be used to calculate point estimates and standard errors for each fixed effect.

If the weighted model fails to converge, the model will be conducted without frequency weights (receiving the error, `Variance-covariance matrix of the parameters is not defined`). Likewise, if the unweighted ordinal regression fails to converge, a weighted mixed logistic regresssion will be conducted. If the weighted mixed logistic regression fails to converge, an unweighted mixed logistic regression will be conducted instead.

### Pilot data (Study 2)

As a proof of concept, the proposed analyses have been conducted on individuals' victimization experiences, which, like security behaviours, is operationalized as a summed variable of multiple binary items, resulting in a similar distribution to security behaviours (see Figures \@ref(fig:icvs-security-hist) and \@ref(fig:icvs-victim-hist)). In this case, `r model_nonconvergence` of 100 analyzed dataframes failed to converge (preventing calculation of standard errors). As such, mixed ordinal regression without frequency weighting was conducted, and had no convergence issues.
