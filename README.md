A combined project for experiments and a multilevel analysis of the effects of inequality on security consumption

# Study 1: inequality_security
Cleaning and analyzing several experiments on the effects of inequality on security consumption

Data is collected via experiments on oTree - procedure available at https://github.com/DallasNovakowski/security_game


# Study 2: icvs_inequality
for multilevel analyses of inequality and archival data on victimization and security measures. 

The data files are too large to host on my GitHub page (particularly the ICVS), but can be found as follows:
[Penn World Tables (PWT; for GDP)](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en)
[The Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID)](https://fsolt.org/swiid/)
[International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS)](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/datasets/id/easy-dataset:44578)
